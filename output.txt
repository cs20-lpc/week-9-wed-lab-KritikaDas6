Array queue test
[Step 1] Empty queue created.
Is the queue empty? Yes
Front: Front error: front: error, queue is empty, cannot access the front
Back: Back error: back: error, queue is empty, cannot access the back

[Step 2] Enqueue a single value (-10)
Queue length: 1
Front: -10 | Back: -10

[Step 3] Removing one element...
Queue length: 0
Is empty? Yes

[Step 4] Enqueue 10 values (0â€“9)
Queue length: 10
Front: 0 | Back: 9

[Step 5] Creating queueCopy via copy constructor...
queueCopy length: 10
queueCopy Front: 0 | Back: 9

[Step 6] Printing and clearing original queue...
Original queue elements: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
Original queue is empty? Yes

[Step 7] Creating queueAssigned and assigning from queueCopy...
queueAssigned length: 10
Front: 0 | Back: 9

[Step 8] Clearing queueCopy...
queueCopy is empty? Yes

[Step 9] Checking that queueAssigned still has data:
queueAssigned length: 10
queueAssigned front: 0 | back: 9

[Step 10] Random enqueue/dequeue simulation (5 random ops)
Dequeued 0
Enqueued 55 | Length: 10
Dequeued 1
Enqueued 3 | Length: 10
Enqueued 88 | Length: 11

Final queueAssigned length: 11
Front: 2 | Back: 88
